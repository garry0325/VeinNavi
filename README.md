---
An image-guided robot for phlebotomy to reduce needle stick injuries in resource-scarce areas. We took the advantage of OpenCV and combined with high-precision motors to construct an automated blood-drawing machine.

_This project was selected as finalist in 2018 EMedIC Global at Chinese University of Hong Kong._

## Motivation

* 15% ~ 45% of healthcare workers experienced needle stick injuries in developing countries
* 35% of hepatitis B & C in healthcare workers are due to needle stick injuries
* 4% of HIV in healthcare workers are due to needle stick injuries

## Goal
* Significantly reduce needle stick injuries
* Zero contacts with needles when performing tasks
* Low cost
